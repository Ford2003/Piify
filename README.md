- 👋 Hi, I’m @Piify
- 👀 I’m interested in Mathematics, Coding as a whole but python is my favourite :), PlayStation of course and getting vaccinated ahaha
- 🌱 I’m currently in year 13 and studying Maths, Further Maths and Physics at A-Level and learning Python on codecademy.com :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on general python programs, but I'd like to go into mathematical and physical simulations as well as other things such as machine learning or neural networks and data analysis.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can @ me or DM me on twitter @TommyFord774 :)
- *^____^* I'd love for you to check out my math explainer YouTube channel Piify https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfeKhycWbG56TDhGmtR0SCg
